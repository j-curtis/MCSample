# MCSample
A class for generating multidimensional samples from a given PDF. 

# Variable Name Conventions
A variable is identified by a few letters identifying the type then _name. The types are indicated via
d_name ==> double
i_name ==> integer 
b_name ==> boolean

pd_name ==> pointer to/array of doubles
pF_name ==> pointer to function 

# Class Atributes
## Protected Attributes: 
int i_dimension; This is an integer indicating the dimension of the sampling space 
double * pd_lower_lim; An array of size [i_dimension] that stores a list of the lower bounds on the sample space (must be a finite space)
double * pd_upper_lim; An array of size [i_dimension] that stores a list of the upper bounds on the sample space (must be a finite space)
double (*pF_pdf)(double *); A pointer to a PDF function that accepts a vector of dimension [i_dimension] and returns the probabiltiy of that point

## Public Methods:
static double getRandomInRange(double d_lower, double d_upper); A static method for randomly generating a double in [d_lower,d_upper)
MCSample(int i_dim, double * pd_lower, double * pd_upper, double (*pF_func)(double *) ); Constructor. Accepts dimension, list of lower bounds, then upper bounds, and finally a pointer to a pdf function. 
double * genSample(); //Returns a vector of doubles of size [i_dimension] from the sample space with a probability distribution given by the PDF passed.


# Usage Notes
This implementation is extremely crude; it heavily relies on unsafe usage of arrays and pointers. Future updates will hopefully use a more robust data structure. 
In addition, using function objects instead of a function pointer would be a desireable upgrade. Usage is fairly simple otherwise.
